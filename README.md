# This Julia code can be use to reproduce the results of the Paper "Lattice-dependent orientational order in active crystals" by Till Welker and Ricard Alert

# The code is structured as follows 

# Definitions of functions. These functions do not need to be adjusted to reproduce results)
#  1. Import Packages
#  2. Functions for Simulations in one and two dimensions
#  3. Read in saved data
#  4. Analysis of order
#  5. Plot Configurations

# Setting Parameters and calling functions. Here you can tune the parameters

#  6. Set Parameters
#  7. Call Functions Here (Example given)
